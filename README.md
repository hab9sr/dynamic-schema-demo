# Dynamic Schema Demo

Example code from a blog post [here](http://hudsonburgess.com/2017-05-18-mean-dynamic-schemas.html). Go check it out!

## Setup

The example in the ```view-example``` directory can be opened from the file system (no server needed).

The example in the ```controller-example``` example directory needs to be served from Node. It also assumes you have [MongoDB installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Run ```npm install```, then ```node backend.js```.
